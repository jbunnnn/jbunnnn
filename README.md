## About Me

Iâ€™m an undergraduate student at IPB University studying computer engineering and applied technologies. Lately Iâ€™ve shifted my focus toward **DevOps, Cloud, and Cybersecurity** â€” building reliable, automated, and secure systems is what motivates me.

I enjoy turning prototypes into production-ready services. I like combining Python automation with infrastructure-as-code, containers, observability, and security practices so tools are not only useful but resilient and maintainable.

Right now Iâ€™m exploring topics like:

* CI/CD pipelines and release automation (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
* Container orchestration and runtime (Docker, Kubernetes)
* Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
* Cloud platforms and services (AWS / GCP / Azure fundamentals)
* Observability and monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)
* System hardening, basic pentesting, and secure defaults
* Scripting and automation with Python & Bash

## Projects & Demos

* **CI/CD for ML Model** â€” Automated training â†’ containerize â†’ deploy to a lightweight inference service using GitHub Actions + Docker + FastAPI. (Demonstrates reliable model delivery and rollback.)

* **Infrastructure-as-Code Playground** â€” Small infra modules in Terraform to provision VPC, managed Kubernetes cluster, and an NGINX ingress. Useful for learning cloud networking and IaC workflows.

* **Observability Stack Demo** â€” Prometheus + Grafana setup for a sample microservice to track latency, error rates, and resource usage.

* **Security-focused Automation** â€” Scripts and checks to automate basic hardening (SSH config, firewall rules, package updates) and simple scanning workflows.

(Links to these repos can be added here as they are published.)

## Certifications & Learning

* **Cisco CCNA 1 & 2** â€” Networking fundamentals, IP addressing, and switching.
* **AWS Cloud Academy â€” Foundations** â€” Intro to cloud services and IAM (linked in original profile).

*Planning / next steps*: pursue cloud provider associate certs (AWS/Azure/GCP) and foundational security certs (e.g., CompTIA Security+ / introductory capture-the-flag practice).
