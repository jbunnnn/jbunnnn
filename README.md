## About Me

I’m currently pursuing my undergraduate studies at IPB University, focusing on computer engineering and applied technologies.

Over the last few months, I’ve been immersing myself in machine learning and ethical AI. I care a lot about building solutions that don’t just “work,” but are responsible, explainable, and genuinely useful.

I enjoy turning concepts into tools, especially with Python. Whether it's a Jupyter notebook, a FastAPI microservice, or a quick automation script — I love the process of solving problems through code.

Right now, I’m exploring topics like:

- Model interpretability (SHAP, LIME)
- Automation with Python
- Deploying lightweight AI models with Streamlit and FastAPI
- Containerization with Docker

## Projects

A few personal projects I've worked on recently:

- [AAPL Stock Prediction](https://github.com/jbunnnn/Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Apple-AAPL--)  
  Time-series modeling and regression on Apple stock prices. Simple, but helped me grasp ML workflows in a real context.

- [EthicoPredict](https://github.com/jbunnnn/EthicoPredict)  
  A small experiment in creating interpretable AI predictions using SHAP. Built with scikit-learn and Streamlit.

- [AI CLI Utils](https://github.com/jbunnnn/ai-cli-utils) *(WIP)*  
  Collection of minimalist command-line tools for AI workflows — from data prep to quick inference.
